* webmacs

*webmacs* is yet another browser for keyboard-based web navigation.

It mainly target emacs-like navigation, and started as a clone (in terms of
features) of [[http://conkeror.org/][conkeror]].

See the documentation manual: https://webmacs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

webmacs is based on qt webengine and written mainly in Python (version 3).

* Features

Short list of features:

- keyboard navigation everywhere (including basic emacs movements in editable
  web content)
- Integrated, fast ad-blocker
- [[https://webmacs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/basic_usage.html#live-documentation][live documentation]]
- [[https://webmacs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_configuration.html][highly customizable using Python]]


* Installation (... and development)

** Using Nix

   See the [[./.README-nix.org][dedicated page]].

** Using pip/virtualenv

Be prepared to have a working c and c++ compiler with python development
library. Note I only have tested on linux.

You will also need the PyQt6 library, which can be installed via pip (or the
system package manager):
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
pip install PyQt6 PyQt6-WebEngine
#+END_SRC

Then you have to check out the repository (do not forget the *recursive* flag):

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/parkouss/webmacs
#+END_SRC

To test it, or work on it, I recommend virtualenv:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
virtualenv --system-site-packages -p python3 venv
# activate the virtualenv
source venv/bin/activate
# install webmacs in there
pip install -e <path_to_webmacs_sources>
# and now to run webmacs
python -m webmacs.main
#+END_SRC

Then you can create a system alias to run it:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
sudo ln -s <path_to_venv>/bin/webmacs /usr/local/bin/webmacs
# now you can use the webmacs command on your system, given that
# /usr/local/bin is in your PATH.
#+END_SRC


* Running tests

To run the tests, you will need a few more dependencies (the virtualenv needs
to be activated):

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# install test dependencies
pip install -r <path_to_webmacs_sources>/test-requirements.txt
# also install the herbstluftwm window manager, using your package manager.
# Example on fedora:
sudo dnf install herbstluftwm
#+END_SRC

Then you can run the tests (the virtualenv needs to be activated):
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
python -m pytest <path_to_webmacs_sources>/tests
# you can run them with the windows visible:
python -m pytest <path_to_webmacs_sources>/tests --no-xvfb
#+END_SRC


* Qt versions support

Every stable Qt version from (and including) 6.0 should work with webmacs.


* Contributions

Contributions are much welcome! Writing this browser is exciting and I love
that, though I don't have many time to spend on it, having a family life and a
job; And anyway the more we are to work on it and use the tool, the better!
