* webmacs

*webmacs* is yet another browser for keyboard-based web navigation.

I started to wrote this as I was a fan user of [[http://conkeror.org/][conkeror]],
but unfortunately with Firefox quantum it is no longer working.

webmacs is based on qt webengine and written mainly in Python (version 3).


* Can I use it on a day to day use ?

I started to use it as my main web browser both at work and home, so I believe
yes. Though there are some corner cases and bugs and sometimes I have to fall
back to some other browser (namely Firefox).


* Installation

Use pip/virtualenv - be prepared to have a working c and c++ compiler with
python development library. Note I only have tested on linux.

You will also need the PyQt5 library, as I believe it can't be installed through
pip. It's easy to install using any package manager though.

Then you have to check out the repository (do not forget the *recursive* flag):

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/parkouss/webmacs
#+END_SRC

To test it, or work on it, I recommend virtualenv:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
virtualenv --system-site-packages -p python3 venv
# activate the virtualenv
source venv/bin/activate
# install webmacs in there
pip install -e <path_to_webmacs_sources>
# and now to run webmacs
python -m webmacs.main
#+END_SRC

Then you can create a system alias to run it:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
sudo ln -s <path_to_venv>/bin/webmacs /usr/local/bin/webmacs
# now you can use the webmacs command on your system, given that
# /usr/local/bin is in your PATH.
#+END_SRC


* Features

*webmacs* quite mimics the conkeror way of browsing. Short list of the already
 supported features:

- navigate through hints (shortcut: *f*)
- go to url or webjump (shortcut: *g*)
- navigate backward (shortcut: *B*)
- navigate forward (shortcut: *F*)
- go to with a default browser webjump (shortcut *s*)
- switch buffer (shortcut *C-x b*)
- close current buffer (shortcut *C-x k*, shortcut *q*)
- open a new view (shortcuts *C-x 3* to split right, *C-x 2* to split bottom)
- switch view (shortcut *C-x o*)
- close view (shortcut *C-x 0*)
- maximize view (shortcut *C-x 1*)
- history access (shortcut *h*)
- ad blocking using [[https://easylist.to/][easylist]]. Implemented in C for high
  performances.
- for go-to and history command, the prefix *C-u* opens the url in a new
  buffer.
- handle basic authentication
- handle basic certificates errors
- automatic save/restore of passwords
- a simple download-manager (go to webmacs://downloads)
- fuzzy matching an completion nearly everywhere (using *Tab* and *Enter* to
 validate)
- emacs like incremental search: starts with *C-s* or *C-r*
- emacs-like navigation key bindings in the page (shortcuts: *C-n*, *C-p* to
  move up and down a little, *C-v*, *M-v* to move the page up and down a bit
  more, *M->* to scroll at the bottom and *M-<* to scroll at the top.
- emacs like navigation binding inside editable web content (*C-f*, *C-b*,
  *M-f*, *M-b*, *C-n*, *C-p*, ...)
- as in emacs, *C-g* to get out of something.
- call command by name (shortcut *M-x*)
- command history within a session in minibuffer input (shortcut *M-n*, *M-p*)
- user configuration written in Python, giving lots of power to
  customize webmacs.
- copy link by hinting (shortcut *c*). Use the special number 0 to
  copy the current url.
- caret navigation. (shortcut *C*) to initialize caret navigation, then navigate
  using (*C-f*, *C-b*, *M-f*, *M-b*, *C-n*, *C-p*, ...) or the arrow keys. It is
  possible to select some web content using *C-Space* to activate/deactivate the
  mark. Once there is a selection, *M-w* will copy it. It is also possible to
  navigate quickly using the incremental search, though this is working well
  with Qt >= 5.10.
- bookmarks (*M* to add a bookmark, *m* to open the bookmark list)
- zoom in and out, using *+* and *-*. *=* to reset the zoom.
- zoom (text only) using *C-+*, *C--* and *C-=*.
- edit text fields with an external editor (defaulting to emacsclient): *C-x e*


* Documentation

Documentation is available on [[http://webmacs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html][readthedocs]]. Currently it is for user
configuration only.


* Desired features

A lot!

- bugs fixes
- help discovery, like C-h in emacs
- more bindings

I can't come up with more right now, but there are a lot more for sure.


* Contributions

Contributions are much welcome! Writing this browser is exciting and I love
that, though I don't have many time to spend on it, having a family life and a
job; And anyway the more we are to work on it and use the tool, the better!
